A lecture on practicing safe Bayesian analyses by having adequate and principled workflow.

Largely to provide motivation to read and work through material/programs developed by Michael Betancourt on Principled Bayesian Workflow  https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/case_studies/principled_bayesian_workflow.html

A conceptual introduction working through a “toyed down” example.
